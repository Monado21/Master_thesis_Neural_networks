# Master_thesis_Neural_networks
This is the code used to train the models presented in the master thesis : "Denoising of Distributed Acoustic Sensing data using 
Convolutional Neural Networks". 
the noise2void neural network can be found here https://github.com/juglab/n2v and was trained with a 
dataset of covariance matrixes created with the file "build covariance matrixes"
